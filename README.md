# 3072
Welcome to 3072, a number-merging game inspired by the popular game "2048", but this time, with a twist. The gameplay is extraordinarily different to 2048, in that it uses 3s instead of 2s; a truly profound and mindbending change in user experience.

This project is built with TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS, ensuring high-performance interactivity and a stunning, responsive design. Your high scores are not lost when you close the game; they are stored locally on your device for you to keep pushing your limits.

# Rules of the Game
- The game is played on a 4x4 grid.
- Use your arrow keys to move the blocks. When two blocks with the same number touch, they merge into one with their sum!
- With every move, another small block appears on an empty spot in the grid.
- The goal is to combine blocks to create a block with the number '3072'.
- The game is over when the grid is filled and you cannot make a valid move.
- Although mobile-responsive, I have not added swipe controls - please use a laptop or desktop.
